**z-transform** :

The z-transform is useful for the manipulation of discrete data sequences and has acquired a new significance in the formulation and analysis of discrete-time systems. It is used extensively today in the areas of applied mathematics, digital signal processing, control theory, population science, and economics. These discrete models are solved with difference equations in a manner that is analogous to solving continuous models with differential equations. The role played by the z-transform in the solution of difference equations corresponds to that played by the Laplace transforms in the solution of differential equations.

**LTI System in transformed domain** :

In this part, we will mainly consider two digital filters: Linear phase FIR filters and IIR filters. Linear Phase FIR filters are an important class of FIR filters. The linear phase of the FIR filter may be achieved by making the impulse response of the FIR filter either symmetric or anti-symmetric. We will use four basic types of it to have a further understanding for it. For IIR filter, we will involve a simple first order filter.
