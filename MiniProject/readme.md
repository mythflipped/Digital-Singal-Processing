This Lab is an interesting mini project. It is about computer generated and played music.

There are many formats for music files, but the main data part of music files is a m * n matrix (where n is the number of channels). 
（a）	Understand the basic elements of music, such as tone, beat, timbre, fundamental frequency, chord, etc.
（b）	Learn how are these musical elements reflected in our data.
（c）	Through MATLAB program, convert a simple music score into a piece of data that can be played into music.
（d）	Generate music that can be played according to the data.
（e）	According to the data, produce music that imitates an instrument
