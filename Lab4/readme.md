- （a）	This laboratory will introduce the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the associated sampling and windowing effects. 
- （b）	This Lab will use two methods to calculate Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), One is FOR loop, the other is matrix method.
- （c）	Learn how to use ‘cputime’ in MATLAB and compare the algorithm complexity of these two methods.
